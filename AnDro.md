### Plan for testing:  
-	Testing accuracy of the algoritm.  
-	Testing optimizations with respect to time and accuracy.  

### End user documentation:  
-	A working model of Pagerank algorithm with optimizations that can rank nodes in a graph, similar to the one used by Google search to rank websites in their search results.
